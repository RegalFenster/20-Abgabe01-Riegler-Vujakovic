## Plan for the first subclass Cocktail

The first subclass of the cocktail class will be able to hold 
mixed drinks from an infinite number of ingredients. 
It will calculate the alcohol content accordingly.

## Plan for second subclass Icecube

The second subclass will allow to add icecubes to the cocktails

## Plan for JUnit Tests

Implement JUnit Tests for subclass Cocktail and SimpleDrink and test for 100% coverage

## Plan for Exceptions in CocktailClass

Implement a list for the mixed drinks a cocktail can hold and try to catch an OverflowException for it
